## Project Overview

Astro Quest is designed to:
- Analyze and visualize data from NASA's public API.
- Provide real-time information about space events, such as meteor showers and planetary positions.
- Enable users to explore the solar system through an interactive VR interface.
- Help identify and track celestial objects like asteroids and satellites.

By simplifying access to space data, Astro Quest brings the wonders of the universe closer to the public and makes space exploration engaging for everyone.

## Motivation

The driving force behind Astro Quest is our passion for space and the desire to make space data accessible to everyone. The NASA Space Apps Challenge provides a platform to showcase how technology can be utilized to solve problems and contribute to scientific discovery.

Our goals include:
- Inspiring curiosity about space.
- Assisting researchers with advanced data analysis tools.
- Promoting STEM education through interactive and enjoyable learning experiences.

## Features

- **Interactive VR Solar System Explorer**: Experience an immersive 3D visualization of the solar system, allowing users to navigate through celestial bodies.
- **Real-Time Space Events**: Stay updated with upcoming space events, including meteor showers, eclipses, and satellite launches.
- **Data Visualization**: Graphical representation of space data such as asteroid trajectories and space weather phenomena.
- **Search and Filter**: Easily search for and filter information about specific celestial objects, enhancing the learning experience.
- **Educational Resources**: Access comprehensive information about various planets, stars, galaxies, and their significance in our universe.

## Technology Stack
